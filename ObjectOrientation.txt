Object Orientation is thinkinhg process
To write the object Orientation code we have to create class
class is consider as data type in python which contains 2 things in it.
1) Characteristics 
2) Behaviours

Data members of class are consider as Characteristics.
When we create object of a class memory for Characteristics gets allocated.

Behaviours are consider as functions
functions are used to provide the facility to the class users.

When we create object of a class one function gets automatically called which is consider as constructor.
In Python __init__ is consider as constructor.
constructor is consider as callback function because it is define by programmer and called by some outsider entity

After creating object of class by using . operator we can access Characteristics as well as Behaviours of a class

object is consider as instance of class

types of variables(Characteristics)

there are two types of variables in class as instance variable and class variable

instance variable is such variable which is created inside the __init__ method using self keyword

about instance variable
1) It should be created __init__ method
2) To access it self keyword is compalsory
3) To access it outsider class we have to create the object
4) If value of instance variable updated by using first object then there will be no change in second object

about class variable
1) It should be create outside __init__ method
2) There is no need of self keyword to access the class variable, class variable gets shared between all object of a class
3) To access class variable outside the class we need class name

about instance method
1)First parameter of instance method should be always SELF.
2) To call the instance method we need OBJECT of class.
*3) Inside instance method we can access instance variable as well as class variable
4) To access class variable inside instance method we have to use name of class and to access instance variable
we need to use self keyword
